        <h1 class="About">About</h1>
        <p>Marian Bantjes was born in 1963, and grew up in Saskatchewan, Canada. She attended York University in Toronto, where she studied English and Cultural Studies, not initially pursuing a design-related field. She dropped out of school after a year and in 1983 ‘fell in’ to a job with book publisher Hartley & Marks, where she did general jobs and helped with paste-ups at TypeWorks. In 1994, she co-founded Digitopolis in Vancouver, and the design practice grew quickly, producing mainly print-based work. But after eight or so years of this, Bantjes dropped out once more. After this Bantjes decided to make a dramatic shift in her career and life. She moved to Vancouver Island and decided to explore her passion for typography and design.</p>
