        <p id="para">A notable collection she builds upon is her Valentine's day collection. The Valentine's Day artworks have become an annual tradition eagerly anticipated by her followers and the design community. Each year's release is awaited with anticipation, creating a sense of excitement around her new creation. She started creating these to send around the world to her friends and family merely to beg the question “When was the last time you received a Valentine?”.

        <h4>Valentines 2004</h4>
        <p>Her very first Valentine was created in 2004 by printing in pink on glassine. She sent <br> these in translucent envelopes around the world. It shows her intricate detailing with <br> emphasis on typography and how that can intertwine with the design.</p>

        <h4>Valentines 2007</h4>
        <p> The second is from 2007 and it is one that started to push her notoriety into the <br> world. For this series, Bantjes decided to hand draw each heart in their own <br> distinctive ways and write each name by their respective hearts to create a sense of <br> personal touch and intimacy within the hearts. She ended up making over 150 of this <br> version and each one is individually unique and creative in its own way.</p>

        <h4>Valentines 2011</h4>
        <p>The final one I wanted to highlight is from 2011. For that year she decided to give <br> people multiple valentines that were all similar but slightly different, so they could <br> keep one or two for themselves and still have a few to give away. She did this by <br> creating a modular heart with which she could easily make 10 variations. Everyone <br> got 4 or 5 different Valentine's hearts to keep and give to others. Her emphasis on<br> the giving nature of her valentines is something I found very touching and unique<br> about her approach to the holiday and was something that was integral to how she<br> decided to design each year.</p>
